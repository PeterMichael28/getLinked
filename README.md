# Hackathon GetLinked Project

## Project Overview
This React project is a web application that incorporates several key features, including a homepage, a registration page, and a contact page. The application utilizes popular technologies such as React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion for animations, and React Router DOM for routing.

### Features

- **Landing page:** The Landing page provides an introduction to the application and serves as the starting point for users. It offers a user-friendly interface with information about the project or your organization.

- **Registration Page:** The registration page allows users to sign up or register for an account. Users can input their details, and the information entered is sent to the backend for processing and storage.

- **Contact Page:** The contact page offers a way for users to get in touch with the organization. Users can fill out a contact form, and the submitted information is sent to the backend for further communication.

### Technologies Used
This project leverages a combination of cutting-edge technologies to provide a smooth and engaging user experience:

- **React:** The project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture makes it easy to manage and organize code.

- **Typescript:** TypeScript is integrated with React to provide static typing, improved development tooling, and enhanced code quality.

- **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS is used for styling the application. It offers a utility-first approach to CSS, making it highly customizable and responsive.

**Framer Motion:** Framer Motion is employed to add delightful animations and transitions to the user interface. This enhances the overall user experience and engagement.

**React Router DOM:** React Router DOM is used for client-side routing. It ensures that users can navigate between different pages of the application seamlessly.

### Backend Integration
The project is integrated with a backend system that handles user registration and contact form submissions. When a user registers or submits a contact form, the data is sent to the backend for processing and storage.
